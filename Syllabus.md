## Course Description
**Prerequisite**: COMP B11 with a grade of "C" or better. 
This is a software engineering course focused on the application of software engineering techniques for the design and development 
of large programs. Topics include object oriented programming, data abstraction, data structures 
and their associated algorithms, and recursion. Students will learn to design, implement, test, 
and debug programs using an object-oriented language. Not open to students who have previously 
received credit for COMS B35.
**Course Corequisites**: NONE

## Student Learning Outcomes
1. Design and implement programs that use arrays, records/structs, strings, linked
lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and trees.
2. Design, implement, test, and debug recursive functions and procedures.
3. Evaluate the tradeoffs in lifetime management of data when using manual memory
management versus reference counting or tracing garbage collection.
4. Explain how abstraction mechanisms support the creation of reusable software
components.
4. Design, implement, test, and debug programs in an objectoriented
language.
6. Compare and contrast objectoriented
analysis and design with structured analysis
and design.

BC embraces individual difference and expects all employees and students to respect these differences and accept an understanding that individuals have unique perspectives, behaviors, and worldviews that may be different from their own.

## Course Policies  
Each student in this course will abide by the Academic Honesty Policy described in the Academic Information and Standards section of the Bakersfield College Catalog.
Collaboration in class while working on assignments is encouraged. Various projects in class will require group work. Students who do not participate equally with others on assigned group projects will receive a grade of zero.
Please be sensitive to the learning environment and the needs of each and every student in class. Avoid causing distractions or engaging in non-class activity. Turn cells phones off before class starts and respond only after class ends. Unless it is an emergency, do not leave class to answer the phone and do not text message. Do not conduct personal conversations when the instructor is lecturing. Disciplinary action including removal from class will result. Personal computers or other electronic devices are not to be used in class for non-class related activities. 

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. The attendance policy as outlined in the campus catalog will be enforced. Students must notify me in the event of class absences.  Any student that is absent for more than two weeks without prior instructor notification may be dropped from the course. If you do not want to be in the class then you must drop yourself from the course.  I will not retroactively drop you if you miss one of the “last day” to drop the course dates.  These dates are listed in class schedule and in the online campus schedule “Important Dates” section. It is also expected that students will notify me before class in the rare instance of needing to leave class early.  Students, not notifying me in advance, will be marked absent upon their early departure.
