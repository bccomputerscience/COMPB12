## Course Description
**Prerequisite**: COMP B11 with a grade of "C" or better. 
This is a software engineering course focused on the application of software engineering techniques for the design and development 
of large programs. Topics include object oriented programming, data abstraction, data structures 
and their associated algorithms, and recursion. Students will learn to design, implement, test, 
and debug programs using an object-oriented language. Not open to students who have previously 
received credit for COMS B35.
**Course Corequisites**: NONE

## Student Learning Outcomes
1. Design and implement programs that use arrays, records/structs, strings, linked
lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and trees.
2. Design, implement, test, and debug recursive functions and procedures.
3. Evaluate the tradeoffs in lifetime management of data when using manual memory
management versus reference counting or tracing garbage collection.
4. Explain how abstraction mechanisms support the creation of reusable software
components.
4. Design, implement, test, and debug programs in an objectoriented
language.
6. Compare and contrast objectoriented
analysis and design with structured analysis
and design.

## Accommodations 
Students with disabilities needing accommodation, including those who had an IEP in high school, should make requests to Disabled Students Programs and Services in CSS 10, or Delano room 1001 (661-395-4334, (661-720-2000 Delano)).  All requests for accommodations require appropriate advance notice to avoid a delay in services. Please discuss approved accommodations with me so we can work together to ensure your access and success at BC

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. The school policy allows up to 2 weeks of absences before I am required to drop you. If you are tardy, you will be assessed an absences for every 2 tardies. The attendance policy as outlined in the campus catalog. Students must notify me in the event of class absences.  Any student that is absent for more than two weeks without prior instructor notification may be dropped from the course. If you do not want to be in the class then you must drop yourself from the course.  I will not retroactively drop you if you miss one of the “last day” to drop the course dates.  These dates are listed in the colleges academic calendar under [Important Dates](https://www.bakersfieldcollege.edu/important-dates). It is also expected that students will notify me before class in the rare instance of needing to leave class early.  Students, not notifying me in advance, may be marked absent upon their early departure.
